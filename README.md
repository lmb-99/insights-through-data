# insights-through-data
In this project I used Python to analyse a database from a subscription service to verify customer information and determine the cancellation rate among these customers. 

Then I was able to analyze where the highest cancellation rates are and the reasons for them. 

Doing this I could propose a solution to reduce this number of cancellations.
